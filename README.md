# Live-Project-Snippets
This is a existing website that I worked on using C# ASP.NET MVC. 

I start off by deleting two [checkboxes](https://github.com/AustinPat/Live-Project-Snippets/blob/master/Checkboxes) in the view, and then setting there values to false automatically.

Then I created an [if statement](https://github.com/AustinPat/Live-Project-Snippets/blob/master/User%20Verification) that made it so a user can only create a new student account if they already had an account in the LMS.
I also added a message that said they must be signed into the LMS to make an account then made it a link to the create an account page.
