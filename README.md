# Live-Project-Snippets
This is a existing website that I worked on using C# ASP.NET MVC. 

I start off by deleting two [checkboxes](https://github.com/AustinPat/Live-Project-Snippets/blob/master/Checkboxes) in the view, and then setting there values to false automatically.

Then I created an [if statement](https://github.com/AustinPat/Live-Project-Snippets/blob/master/User%20Verification) that made it so a user can only create a new student account if they already had an account in the LMS.
I also added a message that said they must be signed into the LMS to make an account then made it a link to the create an account page.

This is what the page looks like if the user is not logged into the LMS.
I also cleaned up the page by shortening the width of the input fields, positioning the words, and adding the contact checkbox message. (I also did this for all the other pages but they look very similar.)

Here I added two new properties to the [Analytics ViewModel]()
